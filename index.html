        <h1>Hey darling!</h1>
        <p>
            I am not what you might consider a writer. Not in my wildest imagination did I ever think I’d hold a pen
            (albeit figuratively) and write about how I feel about someone. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think
            I’d stay on a phone call with someone for long hours. Never in a million years did I suspect that rather my
            heart would become so intertwined with yours – that you would become such an important part of my life to
            the point where my entire world would shift as a result of loving you. I honestly never thought any of these
            as remotely possible. So I want to thank you for not only filling a void in my heart but also for showing me
            that life itself has so much more to offer and that there is room for change.
            <br>
            <br>

            The way I think about you frightens me, and I don’t mean this in the sense that I would do anything stupid
            if I suffered the heartbreak of losing you. Rather it’s like I have always prided myself on my independence,
            but now every minute of the day is filled with inescapable thoughts of you.
            <br>
            <br>

            Today’s a great day. You make today a day to look forward to because with you, today has more meaning. If
            there’s a day I’d stay away from your presence, it’s definitely not today. Today, you were born, and even
            though I was not present, I’m sure there must have been great rejoicing around you. You are a bringer of
            light and love and you’re perfect for me. It’s like a mini-Christmas to me and it kinda sucks that it has
            only 24 hours in it. Until the end of today, I’ll let all who cares to hear that life is beautiful with you
            in it. You’re a big influence to my joy and that life without you is one thing I don’t want to imagine.
            There’s no day like today and when I blow, I’d suggest it should be a national holiday. It sucks we won’t be
            together today but and one day, we’ll spend your birthday in the most exciting way.
            <br>
            <br>

            You are the pepperoni to my pizza, the Bruno Fernandes to my Manchester United, the laugh track to my
            otherwise boring sitcom. When you cross my mind, the color yellow comes to mind to match your personality. I
            love you and really, really, really need you. And hopefully you feel the same, or else I’d be tempted to
            write another letter. I celebrate you and I’m proud to say you’re mine. My life has been beautiful with you
            in it and there’s a lot to like about you. You will live in favour and peace from now on and you’ll only get
            better. I wish you every good thing you wish yourself and every good thing you deserve.
            <br>
            <br>

            Have a memorable day!
